## How to Reuse Components

This project is designed with modular components that can be easily reused in other projects. Here are some ways to do that:

- **Navigation Bar**: Copy the `<header>` and related CSS/JS to other projects for a responsive menu.
- **Section Layouts**: Each section (About, Services, Doctors, etc.) is modular and can be reused by copying the HTML and corresponding CSS.
- **Card Components**: Doctor and review cards are reusable UI blocks.
- **Color Palette**: Defined in `:root` in CSS, can be imported into other projects for consistent theming.
- **Menu Toggle JS**: The menu toggle logic in `script.js` is generic and can be reused for any mobile menu.
